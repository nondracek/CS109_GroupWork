    "## Automated Breast Cancer Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we will consider the problem of early breast cancer detection from X-ray images. Specifically, given a candidate region of interest (ROI) from an X-ray image of a patient's breast, the goal is to predict if the region corresponds to a malignant tumor (label 1) or is normal (label 0). The training and test data sets for this problem is provided in the file `hw6_dataset.csv`. Each row in these files corresponds to a ROI in a patient's X-ray, with columns 1-117 containing features computed using standard image processing algorithms. The last column contains the class label, and is based on a radiologist's opinion or a biopsy. This data was obtained from the KDD Cup 2008 challenge.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Fit a logistic regression classifier to the training set and report the  accuracy of the classifier on the test set. You should use $L_2$ regularization in logistic regression, with the regularization parameter tuned using cross-validation. \n",

    "    \n",
    "For applications with imbalanced class labels, in this case when there are many more healthy subjects ($Y=0$) than those with cancer ($Y=1$), the classification accuracy may not be the best metric to evaluate a classifier's performance. As an alternative, we could analyze the confusion table for the classifier. \n",

    "## Question 2: ROC Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Another powerful diagnostic tool for class-imbalanced classification tasks is the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Notice that the default logistic regression classifier in `sklearn` classifies a data point by thresholding the predicted class probability $\\hat{P}(Y=1)$ at 0.5. By using a different threshold, we can adjust the trade-off between the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) of the classifier. The ROC curve allows us to visualize this trade-off across all possible thresholds.\n",
